# Medicine Ordering App (Medmart)

_<h2>Purpose</h2>_
This is a MediBuddy clone that I planned to make for a 12th grade Computer Science Project. I used Kivy Module for the Graphic User Interface.
The scope of this app is pretty basic right now but I do plan to make it better down the road.

_<h2>Details</h2>_
Make sure you have a `.env` file with `passwd=` set to your SQL password.<br>
The MySQL Database name is set to `medmart`.<br>
As for the table(s):-

_<h2>Note</h2>_
This repository will keep being updated as time goes on and I make more changes.<br>
That's pretty much all you need to know :)
